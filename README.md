this is a work in progress if you stumble on it and will publish a release once it is functioning, it is designed to be used in portainer via a github pull

  1. Split Nginx conf files to load balance read and write
  2. Add exporters to compose yml
  3. Rename containers in commpose yml to eliminate dupes
  4. Update yml's for namechanges
  5. Test in portainer to correct file file mappings
